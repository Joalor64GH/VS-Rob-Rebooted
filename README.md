# VS Rob: Rebooted!
A high quality remake of the [VS Rob](https://gamebanana.com/wips/66151) mod from 2022! <br>

Originally starring in the first song of Week 2 in [VS Bam](https://joalor64.itch.io/fnf-vs-bam-w2-update), Rob finally has his own week just for him!
Enjoy his silly little robot beats and see what else this mod has to offer!

Also, the code formatting might give you an aneurysm because I was lazy.
